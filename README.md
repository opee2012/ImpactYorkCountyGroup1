# Impact York County Project
- CSCI 475, Group 1
- Winthrop University Fall 2023

The purpose of this project is to provide the staff of Impact York County with the ability to upload  SCDHEC health data and statistics to a publicly viewable organized dashboard. Users will be able to view the dashboard at any time. Staff can upload excel spreadsheets which are then used to populate the dashboard with both numeric and visual data in the form of graphs and charts. Administrators can do what staff do, but they have the ability to add or remove staff and admin accounts.
