## For setup

- Ensure that you have NodeJS installed on your computer. Once you do, run `npm -v` to make sure that npm is working. If not, try restarting VSCode.

- Once you have verified that npm is installed, in both the server/ and client/ directories only, run `npm install` to install all required node packages.

- In the server/ folder ensure that you have the `.env` folder otherwise the program will not function properly.

## To start both the server and the client:

In the server/ directory, run:

## `npm start dev`
